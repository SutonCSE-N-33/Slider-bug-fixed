                                    <h3>what is wet dream?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I sometimes wake up with a wet, sticky spot on my underwear or pajama pants.
                                        It's not urine, so what is it?
                                        Chances are that you had a "wet dream" — something that can be embarrassing and
                                        confusing, but is completely normal. A wet dream is when a guy ejaculates (or
                                        "cums") while he's sleeping. During ejaculation, semen (the fluid containing
                                        sperm) comes out of the penis and this is what you noticed on your underwear or
                                        pajama pants. Wet dreams usually happen during dreams that have sexual images.
                                        Sometimes guys wake up from a wet dream, but sometimes they sleep through it.
                                        Wet dreams begin during puberty when the body starts making more testosterone, a
                                        male hormone. Some guys may feel embarrassed or even guilty about having wet
                                        dreams. But they're are a normal part of growing up and you can't stop them from
                                        happening. Most guys have wet dreams at some point during puberty, and even
                                        sometimes as adults. Wet dreams usually happen less as guys get older, though.
                                        {In the simplest terms, a wet dream is when you ejaculate or secrete vaginal
                                        fluids during your sleep. Your genitals are hypersensitive during shut-eye time
                                        because there’s more blood flow to the area. So if you’re having a dream that’s
                                        turning you on, there’s a chance you’ll orgasm and not know it until you wake
                                        up.}


                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Is it the same thing as a sleep orgasm or nocturnal emission? </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Yup. “Wet dream,” “sleep orgasm,” and “nocturnal emission” all mean the same
                                        thing. In fact, “nocturnal emission” is the formal name for orgasming when you
                                        sleep. So, if you hear people talking about nocturnal emissions or sleep
                                        orgasms, remember they’re talking about wet dreams.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Can you only have a wet dream during puberty?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Not at all. Wet dreams are more common during your teenage years because your
                                        body is going through some major hormonal changes that affect your sexual
                                        maturity. But adults can have erotic dreams, too — especially if they’re
                                        sexually active.
                                        That said, sleep orgasms do happen more infrequently as you get older. That’s
                                        because, unlike during puberty, your hormone levels aren’t out of control.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Can women have them, too?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Absolutely! Sure, a quick Google search may make it seem as if only teenage boys
                                        have wet dreams, but that’s far from reality. Both women and men can experience
                                        arousal while in dreamland.
                                        In fact, research shows that most women have their first sleep orgasm before
                                        they turn 21.
                                        Plus, according to a 1986 study published in the Journal of Sex Research, 37
                                        percent of college-aged women reported experiencing at least one orgasm during
                                        their sleep. That shows us that female wet dreams are nothing new.
                                        Women don’t always orgasm from a wet dream, though. Men will know they’ve had an
                                        orgasm during their sleep because they’ll find discharged semen on their clothes
                                        or bed sheets. But, for a woman, the presence of vaginal fluids doesn’t mean you
                                        had an orgasm; instead, secretions could mean you were sexually aroused without
                                        reaching orgasm.

                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Is it normal to have wet dreams all the time?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As a teenager going through puberty, yes. As an adult, not so much. Don’t worry,
                                        it’s not actually abnormal. As we age, our hormone levels decrease, which
                                        affects the frequency of wet dreams. But that doesn’t mean you won’t have one as
                                        an adult.
                                        If you’re worried that you’re having too many wet dreams, consider chatting with
                                        your family doctor to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to
                                        them. If nothing unusual is found, and you’re still concerned, your doctor may
                                        refer you to a counselor. A therapist may help you get to the root of your
                                        dreams — what they mean and why you seem to have them all the time.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What should I do if I have a wet dream?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        That depends. You shouldn’t be ashamed of having a wet dream — they’re perfectly
                                        normal and could be quite fun! If you’re comfortable with your dreams, use them
                                        as a chance to explore your fantasies, sexuality, and inner desires.
                                        But if what you’re dreaming about makes you uncomfortable, reach out to a
                                        therapist. Your counselor can help you explore what’s on your mind and why.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Will sex dreams always end in orgasm?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Nope. Think about it this way: Do you have an orgasm every time you have sex?
                                        Probably not. So, the same applies with sex dreams. You may have a dream about
                                        doing something sexual, but it doesn’t mean you’ll end up having an orgasm, even
                                        if your dream arouses you. On the other hand, you may have a sex dream that
                                        makes you climax, but doesn’t cause you to ejaculate or become wet.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Are sex dreams the only thing that causes sleep orgasm?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Not necessarily. Sex dreams don’t always make you orgasm during your sleep. And
                                        you don’t always have a sleep orgasm because of a sex dream. The pressure or
                                        sensation of bedding against your genitals could also possibly trigger an
                                        orgasm. It all depends on what your body finds arousing.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>I have sleep orgasms but have a hard time having orgasms otherwise — why?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        First things first: It’s not unusual to have a hard time having orgasms. The
                                        ability to orgasm is different for everybody, and a lot of people have trouble
                                        climaxing. In fact, studies have shown that 75 percent of women can’t orgasm
                                        from vaginal intercourse alone. Of that number, 5 percent of women never have
                                        orgasms, while 20 percent seldom do.
                                        If it’s easier for you to have sleep orgasms, then it’s worth exploring what
                                        about your dreams is turning you on, and how you could incorporate that into
                                        your sex life. Is it a different position? A certain move? Really take the time
                                        to connect with your needs and wants, even if that happens to be in dreamland.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>I’ve never had a wet dream. Is this normal?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Absolutely. Not everyone will have a wet dream. Some people may have a few,
                                        while others may have a lot. Then there are people who have wet dreams as
                                        teenagers, but not as adults. Dreams are super personal, individual experiences
                                        that are different for everyone.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Can you make yourself have a wet dream?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Maybe. Research suggests that sleeping in the prone position — meaning on your
                                        stomach — could cause you to have sexual or lustful dreams. Why this link exists
                                        is unclear, though. But if you want to test the theory, lay on your belly in bed
                                        before you go to sleep.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Can you prevent wet dreams?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        No, not really. Sure, some dream experts suggest you may be able to control your
                                        dreams. How so? Well, according to research, you may be able influence your
                                        dreamland narrative by either thinking of a subject before dozing off or by

                                        either thinking of a subject before dozing off or by using outside stimuli while

                                        But trying these tactics doesn’t mean you’ll actually control your dreams
                                        successfully. That means there’s no guarantee that you can really prevent a wet

                                            body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
                                        appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the
                                        overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You
                                        can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's
                                        also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                                        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
